Each can be weighted per compartment, and turned off/on through this parameter choice. In lockdown, all commuting movements are turned off.\nCurrently, only the symptomatic and asymptomatic infectious classes can generate and spread virus, and f_c = 0 for all others.\nNewly generated virus infects other susceptible groups either as an instantaneous force of infection (e.g. aerosol transmission) or through environmental transmission (e.g. through contact with a surface), both at separate rates.

There is no movement between locations, but instead transitions between different categories.\nAn overall matrix housing the abundances per grid square and per disease category is housed in the EpiSystem, along with information on environment and a lookup table of moves between different grid squares for each kernel.\nAt every iteration of the update step, this matrix is updated in place to avoid additional memory allocation.\nMovement of the virus is now deterministic in the first stage of the virus update loop, and then drawn from a Poisson distribution based on this result in the second stage.","category":"page"},{"location":"epi/#Epidemiology","page":"SCRC","title":"Epidemiology","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"epi/","page":"SCRC","title":"SCRC","text":"Code supporting epidemiological simulations developed during the RAMP period (March - December 2020) was originally found on a separate fork.","category":"page"},{"location":"epi/","page":"SCRC","title":"SCRC","text":"Development on this resource will be slowed down until both code bases can be reintegrated here.

Here, we simulated an island ecosystem with two resources, water and sunlight, each on a gradient West to East and South to North, respectively. All species were seeded with the same resource requirements and vital rates. Abundance increased in squares with greater amounts of water and sunlight, with some edge effects. Next, we investigated the relationship between abundance and area size. As expected, ecosystems with greater areas could support more individuals, and these abundances were invariant to the resolution of the grid. We also tested in an ecosystem in which species demographic and dispersal rates and resource requirements varied. Under these circumstances, some species not favoured for the conditions go extinct, but most species survive to the end of the simulation.","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/","page":"Examples","title":"Examples","text":"## MORE ENERGY MORE ABUNDANCE ##\nnumSpecies = 100;
