md"# _A quick introduction to EcoSISTEM.jl!_

Welcome to the EcoSISTEM package. You can use us to simulate communities of plants! In any simulation, we run multiple species competing, dispersing and dying over time and space. You can set up any type of Ecosystem you like, but there are a few in-built functions to make things easier.

Have a go below and remember you can write `?` to check the documentation for any Julia function or variable."

_P.S. you'll notice that the number of grid cells doesn't really change the results of plot A - this is because the overall area remains the same and the simulation is built to be invariant to grid size. Neat!_

md"## The nuts and bolts

If you have taken a peak at the code to plot the results above (by clicking the eye icon), you'll notice it is fairly dense! Let's go through it bit by bit and see how we built an `Ecosystem`, the base type which holds all the information about species and their environment.

### _Let's start with the environment_

Something simple perhaps! We'll build a 10 by 10 grid, because in our world everything is gridded. This abiotic environment will house information on the habitat (like climate) and what resources are available (e.g. sunlight and water for the plants). It is its own Julia type, a `GridAbioticEnv`. For a simple example, we'll build a grid of temperature as the habitat and water as the resource:
"

begin
	# Here is our grid
	grid = (10, 10)

	# The total area we would like it to be
	area_size = 100.0*km^2

	# The total water it will have available
	totalW = 200.0mm/km^2

	# Overall temperature it will be
	totalT = 298.0K

	# Perfect, now we can build a simple habitat!
	temp_env = simplehabitatAE(totalT, grid, totalW, area_size)

	# Let's plot it to see what it looks like
	heatmap(temp_env.habitat.matrix ./ K, clim = (278, 308), title = "Habitat", layout = 2)
	heatmap!(temp_env.budget.matrix ./ mm, title = "Resource", subplot = 2, clim = (100, 200))
	
end

### _Now to add the species!_

Similarly to the abiotic environment, all information about species is housed in its own Julia type, called a `SpeciesList`. We'll set one up now:

	# And how many individuals overall
	numInd = 100_000
	
	# Great, now we'll randomly allocate those individuals evenly (but randomly!) 
	# across the species
	start_abuns = rand(Multinomial(numInd, numSpp))
	
	# Are they all native?
	is_native = fill(true, numSpp)
	
	# Next up, we need to decide on some base rates for the simulation to run on - 
	# like birth and death
	death_rates = 0.15/ year
	birth_rates = death_rates
	
	# There are also a couple of parameters that should be set about how the species 
	# lifespan relates to their resource consumption (longevity) and how well they 
	# survive in their current environment based on their traits (survival)
	longevity = 1.0
	survival = 0.1
	
	# Finally, how many times boost can they get to their reproduction from available 
	# resources?
	resource_boost = 1.0
	
	# Let's assume that all species are equal for these parameters
	parameters = EqualPop(birth_rates, death_rates, longevity, survival, 
		resource_boost)
	
	# Now we have to consider movement - let's say the species move an average of 
	# 2.4km according to a Gaussian kernel
	average_dist = fill(2.4, numSpp) .* km
	gauss_kernel = GaussianKernel.(average_dist, 10e-10)
	
	# Because we are considering plants, let's assume the seed production is combined 
	# with dispersal, so only new seeds move
	move = BirthOnlyMovement(gauss_kernel, Torus())
	
	# We must also decide how much water each species needs per timestep
	water_req=(100.0nm/m^2);
	size = 1.0m^2
	water_vec = WaterRequirement(fill(water_req * size, numSpp))
	
	# Plus, their niche width - the range of habitats they find suitable
	niche_width = fill(2.0, numSpp) .* K
	
	# And what is their niche optimum - here we have a range around 25 degrees
	optima = 298.0K .+ niche_width .* range(-3, stop = 3, length = numSpp)
	
	# Let's combine these pieces of information together so that each species has a 
	# Gaussian curve representing their match to the current temperature
	traits = GaussTrait(optima, niche_width)
	
	# Okay, now we are ready for our species list!
