# Simulation.jl

**Simulation** is a [Julia](http://www.julialang.org) package that provides functionality
for simulating species undergoing dynamic biological processes such as birth, death,
competition and dispersal, as well as environmental changes in climate and habitat. This
branch has now been adapted to include basic functionality for spatially explicit, dynamic,
stochastic SIR models.

The package was primarily developed for global scale simulations of plant biodiversity.
The underlying model for this is described in the arXiv paper [arXiv:1911.12257 (q-bio.QM)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.12257)
*Dynamic virtual ecosystems as a tool for detecting large-scale responses of biodiversity
to environmental and land-use change*. Future updates to the package functionality involve
incorporating age-structure and more complex epidemiological models.

This package is in alpha now, so please raise an issue if you find any problems.
