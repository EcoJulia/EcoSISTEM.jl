# Simulation.jl

**Simulation** is a [Julia](http://www.julialang.org) package that provides functionality
for simulating species undergoing dynamic biological processes such as birth, death,
competition and dispersal, as well as environmental changes in climate and habitat.

The package was primarily developed for global scale simulations of plant biodiversity.
The underlying model for this is described in the arXiv paper [arXiv:1911.12257 (q-bio.QM)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.12257)
*Dynamic virtual ecosystems as a tool for detecting large-scale responses of biodiversity
to environmental and land-use change*.

This package is in alpha now, so please raise an issue if you find any problems.
