# Epidemiology

Code supporting epidemiological simulations developed during the RAMP period (March - December 2020) was originally found on a separate [fork](https://github.com/ScottishCovidResponse/Simulation.jl).

Development on this resource will be slowed down until both code bases can be reintegrated here. See the [Scottish Covid Response Consortium](https://scottishcovidresponse.github.io/) for more details of the project.
